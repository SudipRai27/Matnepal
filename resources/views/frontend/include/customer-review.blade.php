            <p>Excellent experience with Mountain Adventure Trekking Pvt Ltd<br>
            Mountain Adventure Trekking Pvt Ltd had been the agent supporting treks I did since the 1980s. I must compliment, particularly Mr Roka Deepak, the Director of the company for the efficiency in providing the guide and porters for all my treks in the Everest, Annapurna and other regions in Nepal. The supports provided has led to the success in reaching all destinations including Everest Base Camp, Annapura Base Camp, Poon Hill, Helambu, MuKtinak. Also, we enjoyed the magnificent mountain scenaries along the journeys towards all these destinations with the safe guidance of the guides and efficiency of the porters. Thank you very much Mr Deepak and all the guides and porters who have helped us achieved the satisfaction and gaining wonderful experiences trekking one of the most beautiful places on earth.</p>

            I and my friend had been with Mountain Adventure Trekking (MAT) in our last 3 trips to Nepal since 2009. We were attracted to MAT for the personal touch of the company director. He personally<br>
            received us on arrival at the airport, sit with us for all the farewell dinners he gave, and sent us off<br>
            at the airport at the end of the trip.</p>
            <p>He assigned very good, hardworking, experienced English speaking guide for each of our trips<br>
                over the years. The services provided by the guide were very good and we were very satisfied.</p>
            <p>Our Annapurna Circuit Trek turned out well and we were able to trek 80% off the main roads because the guide had been on this AC trek on many occasions and familiar with the terrain and<br>
                routes. He booked us in good lodges and provided sufficient foods during our daily trek. We were happy with his services. </p>
            <p>Overall, we were happy with the service provided by MAT.</p>

            My second trip to Nepal and I did a short trek at Nagarkot. My first trip with them was the ABC trek in 2014. Deepak and his team of sherpas and porters have always been very hospitable, friendly and helpful, and it’s one of the reasons why I’ve always wanted to return to Nepal. From accommodation to trekking logistics, food, service and help rendered, everything was thoughtfully planned. Highly recommended for any trekking trip to Nepal!</p>

            We had a good time in Nepal. We visited Pokhra and Kathmandu. Mr. Deepak Roka took personal interest and came with our group of 9 people to Pokhra. He got us standby on an earlier flight. The arrangements in both Pokhra and Kathmandu were very good including hotels, food, guides and sight-seeing.</p>

            <p></p><p>My 9 day trek was a wonderfull experience for me despite the coldness and some tough hiking day up to 11400 feet was because of the guide mr kumar rai and the potter chatra from mountain adventure trekking who have taken care of us so well for our safetly and the food and accomodation. I also wish to thank the owner of mountain adventure trekking Mr Deepak who has personally meet me at the airport and his personal commitment to make sure all arrangement was done to make sure my trek goes well with no problem. He also make sure i get to airport in time for my depature home. Overall i highly recommed any trekker to use this company for any trekking in nepal.</p>
